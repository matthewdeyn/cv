        <p><em>Coffee lover and creative&#9749;</em></p>
        <p><em>During my earlier adult years I have worked in the specialty coffee industry in a multitude of roles: from barista to trainer to account manager to mobile-cafe operator to roaster.
            I am passionate about great coffee and the opportunities that it can provide for many. Having originally studied music production at university, I am undoubtedly a creative and have
            always seeked to utilise this trait when working. After experiencing time working abroad in cities such as Melbourne and Saudi Arabia, I am now based in Prague and building my skills in programming.</em>
